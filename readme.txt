The files in this directory provide input/output routines for lab 1.

There is javadoc documentation in the doc directory. Read the javadoc
to understand how the four classes work. For the simple reflex agent,
you'll want to use RoverSampleSensor; for the reflex agent with state
you'll want to use MovingRoverSensors.

You can test out the classes using:

java RoverSampleSensor -file <FILENAME_FROM_PART1>

java MovingRoverSensors -file <FILENAME_FROM_PART2>

Look at the main function in the .java files to see how these classes
are used.

How to Run: 

I have been running it in eclipse using by going to run configurations, then arguments tab, and then program arguments
and putting -file hw1-data1.txt if I wanted to use hw1-data1.txt as my file. This works for RoverSample and MovingRoverSample
