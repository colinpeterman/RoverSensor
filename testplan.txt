How did you test your code?

I started out first by making sure my code was working correctly with the provided file. Then
I created files with different lengths of a state space as well as boulders places in different 
locations. I wanted to make sure that it stopped with different things at the end so I made files
that has two boulders at the end, no boulders at the end, and then just one boulder at the end. After
some fixing some issues I found testing it now works with anything at the end as well as any boulders 
throughout the problem.

A way I made sure they were correct was by drawing out the space and following the positions and actions
to make sure it was the correct sequence and grabbed the soil as well correctly
